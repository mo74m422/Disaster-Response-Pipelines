### Disaster Response Pipeline Project


This project is to classify disaster response messages through machine learning





### Content 

Data
process_data.py: reads in the data, cleans and stores it in a SQL database. Basic usage is python process_data.py MESSAGES_DATA CATEGORIES_DATA NAME_FOR_DATABASE
disaster_categories.csv and disaster_messages.csv (dataset)
DisasterResponse.db: created database from transformed and cleaned data.
Models
train_classifier.py: includes the code necessary to load data, transform it using natural language processing, run a machine learning model using GridSearchCV and train it. Basic usage is python train_classifier.py DATABASE_DIRECTORY SAVENAME_FOR_MODEL
App
run.py: Flask app and the user interface used to predict results and display them.
templates: folder containing the html templates

### Instructions:

1/ Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

2/To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db
To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl
Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app. python run.py

3/Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
